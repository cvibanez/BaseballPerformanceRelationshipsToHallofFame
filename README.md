# Baseball Performance Relationships to Hall of Fame
## Data Mining

### Introduction
This project was for a data mining course at Bellevue University.  The projectâ€™s goal was to determine the relationships between baseball player performance and election to the Major League Baseball (MLB) Hall of Fame.

### Tools
* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Plotly
* Matplotlib
* SciPy
* Seaborn

### Data
Kaggle-https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank. 
This dataset is a collection of historical baseball data from 1871 to 2015.  It contains 20 files, and the main tables include a master table for player and biographical info, batting statistics, pitching statistics, and fielding statistics.  There are also tables that contain information for player salaries, awards, All-Star appearances, and Hall of Fame votes.


### Analysis Methods
* Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
* Heat Map
* Gap Plot
* Inertia Plot

### Conclusion
There is a relationship between player performance metrics and whether the player is elected into the Hall of Fame.  However, the strength of that relationship is somewhat distorted.  Other factors such as player position and subjective views on the players have some impact on the Hall of Fame status for a player.
